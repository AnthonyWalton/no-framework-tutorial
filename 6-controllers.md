### Controllers

When I talk about a controller in this tutorial then I am just referring to a class that has handler methods. I am not talking about [MVC (Model-View-Controller)](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/modelViewController.html) controllers.

So forget about MVC and instead let's worry about [separation of concerns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns).
