## Create a PHP application without a framework

### Introduction

If you are really new to the language, this is not for you. This tutorial is aimed at people who have grasped the basics of PHP and know a little bit about object-oriented programming.

You should at least heard of [SOLID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29). If you are not familiar with it, now would be a good time to familiarize yourself with the principles before you start with the tutorial.

I saw a lot of people coming into the Stack Overflow PHP chatroom and asking if framework X is any good. Most of the time the answer was that they should just use PHP and not a framework to build their application. But many are overwhelmed by this and don't know where to start.

So my goal with this is to provide an easy resource that people can be pointed to. In most cases a framework does not make sense and writing an application from scratch with the help of some third party packages is much, much easier than some people think.

So let's get started right away with the [first part](1-front-controller.md).
