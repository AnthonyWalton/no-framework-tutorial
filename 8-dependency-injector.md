### Dependency Injector

A dependency injector resolves the dependencies of your class and makes sure that the correct objects are injected when the class is instantiated.

My favorite injector is [Auryn](https://github.com/rdlowrey/Auryn), so install `rdlowrey/auryn` with composer or use one of the alternatives below:

[Pimple](http://pimple.sensiolabs.org/), [Orno DI](https://github.com/orno/di), [PHP-DI](https://github.com/mnapoli/PHP-DI)

to be continued...
